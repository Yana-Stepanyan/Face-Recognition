-   Recognize faces using webcam input
    
-   Grant or deny access visually using colored rectangles (green for access, red for denial)

## âœ… How to Use

### 1. **Register a Face**

Run the following to register a new person:

bash

CopyEdit

`python face_recognition.py` 

-   Enter the persons name.
    
-   Enter the rooms they can access (comma-separated).
    
-   Press **`S`** to capture the face when ready.
    
-   Press **`Q`** to exit.
    

Face data will be saved in the `registered_faces/` folder.

----------

### 2. **Recognize and Grant/Deny Access**

Run the main recognition system:

bash

CopyEdit

`python main.py` 

-   The webcam will open and recognize registered faces.
    
-   Displays:
    
    -   Name
        
    -   Access status
        
    -   Room name (currently generic "room")
        

Press **`Q`** to quit.

----------

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

-   Both scripts must be used together â€” registering faces before running the recognition script.
    
-   You can improve results by registering each person with multiple photos.
    
-   Make sure the webcam has good lighting during registration and recognition.
